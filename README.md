This is my Emacs config.  It is intended for use with

## Setup

  $ rake install

## Credits

This is spliced together with snippets I've found across the web,
primarily based on the topfunky's
[emacs-starter-kit](http://github.com/topfunky/emacs-starter-kit) and
[defunkt's emacs config](http://github.com/defunkt/emacs).
